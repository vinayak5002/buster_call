/* 
Reversing Numbers

Write a program which reads a sequence and prints it in the reverse order.

Input
The input is given in the following format:

n
a1 a2 . . . an
n is the size of the sequence and ai is the ith element of the sequence.

Output
Print the reversed sequence in a line. Print a single space character between adjacent elements (Note that your program should not put a space character after the last element).

Constraints
n ≤ 100
0 ≤ ai < 1000
Sample Input 1
5
1 2 3 4 5
Sample Output 1
5 4 3 2 1
Sample Input 2
8
3 3 4 4 5 8 7 9
Sample Output 2
9 7 8 5 4 4 3 3
