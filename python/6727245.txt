/*
How many ways?

Write a program which identifies the number of combinations of three integers which satisfy the following conditions:

You should select three distinct integers from 1 to n.
A total sum of the three integers is x.
For example, there are two combinations for n = 5 and x = 9.

1 + 3 + 5 = 9
2 + 3 + 4 = 9
Input
The input consists of multiple datasets. For each dataset, two integers n and x are given in a line.

The input ends with two zeros for n and x respectively. Your program should not process for these terminal symbols.

Constraints
3 ≤ n ≤ 100
0 ≤ x ≤ 300
Output
For each dataset, print the number of combinations in a line.

Sample Input
5 9
0 0
Sample Output
2
